Key areas to improve to reach 9.5–10/10
• Accessibility and alternative access
   • External switch support: integrate UIAccessibilitySwitchControl or direct HID switch hotkeys (e.g., space/enter already handled; consider MFi/Bluetooth switch profiles and explicit switch assignments for next/select/cancel).
   • VoiceOver: audit focus order and accessibility labels/values/hints on all interactive elements, especially custom tiles, scanning focus rings, and context menus.
   • Dynamic Type and layout: you’ve added some dynamicTypeSize ranges; verify large accessibility sizes throughout TileGridView, SentenceBarView, and SettingsView to avoid truncation or overflow.
• Language and symbol ecosystems
   • Add robust multi-language workflows: full UI localization, per-profile language settings, and on-device language models for prediction.
   • Symbol libraries: optional integration with open symbol sets (e.g., Twemoji, OpenMoji) or import of commercial sets if licenses permit; bulk assignment tools.
   • Morphology/grammar tools: support verb inflections, plurals, negation, pronoun variants, and quick modifiers (e.g., “not”, “-ed”, “-ing”) to increase communicative efficiency.
• Prediction and rate of communication
   • Your PredictionService hooks are present; consider improved language models, personalization from usage, and next-word/phrase prediction tuned for AAC (core/fringe weighting and recency).
   • Phrasebanks/templates for common routines (e.g., “I want …”, “I feel …”) with slot filling for faster composition.
• Sharing and continuity
   • iCloud Drive/CloudKit sync for boards across devices, versioning, and conflict resolution.
   • Caregiver/therapist “remote edit” mode with a pairing workflow to edit on a second device while the user communicates.
• Safety, privacy, compliance
   • Ensure Info.plist􀰓 has NSMicrophoneUsageDescription, NSSpeechRecognitionUsageDescription, and NSCameraUsageDescription (your code requires all three).
   • Consider a privacy mode (no recents logging), PIN-protected Admin area, and optional data export encryption.
   • If used in clinical contexts, document data handling and consider HIPAA-aligned practices where applicable.
• Onboarding and guidance
   • First-run tutorial for access methods (scanning, dwell), tile editing, and backup/export reminders.
   • In-app “Help & Support” looks present—consider embedding short videos or interactive walkthroughs.
• Performance and robustness
   • Continue to test on lower-end devices with large boards for scrolling and grid performance; consider prefetching images and avoiding large synchronous image reads on main.
   • More unit/UI tests around editing flows, scanning transitions, and export/import with images and links.

Concrete suggestions you can action soon
• Add a Profiles feature: separate user profiles with their own preferences, language, and boards.
• Expand scanning options: auto-scan with dwell select, configurable auditory cues, and scanning groups (e.g., quadrant → row → item).
• Provide a quick-access toolbar for grammatical modifiers and sentence-level actions (clear, speak, save, copy) with large targets in all layouts.
• Improve backup UX: schedule-friendly reminders, one-tap export to a chosen iCloud folder, and optional auto-backup when editing is unlocked.
• Add Shortcuts/Siri intents to speak a favorite or open a page, and a Share Audio action to export a synthesized utterance as an audio file if desired.
• Finish full localization (UI strings) to match your language features.
